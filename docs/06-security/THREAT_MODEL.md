# Threat Model

This document describes the threat modeling process and key threats for the Egypt Edututor platform.

## Overview

Threat modeling is performed to:
- Identify and prioritize security risks
- Guide security controls and mitigations
- Ensure compliance with PDPL and best practices

## Threat Modeling Process
- Define assets (student data, credentials, content)
- Identify threats (STRIDE: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege)
- Assess risk likelihood and impact
- Define mitigations and controls
- Review and update regularly

## Key Threats
- Unauthorized access to student data
- API key leakage
- LLM prompt injection
- Data exfiltration via vector DB
- Insider threats
- DDoS attacks on API endpoints

## Mitigations
- Strong authentication and RBAC
- Input validation and output encoding
- Rate limiting and anomaly detection
- Encryption of sensitive data
- Regular pen testing and code review

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Threat model reviewed quarterly
- [ ] All critical threats have mitigations
- [ ] Security controls tested regularly
