# Penetration Testing Playbook

This document provides a playbook for penetration testing (pen testing) the Egypt Edututor platform.

## Overview

Penetration testing is performed to:
- Identify vulnerabilities in the platform
- Test security controls and incident response
- Ensure compliance with PDPL and best practices

## Pen Test Phases

### 1. Reconnaissance
- Map public endpoints (API, web, mobile)
- Identify exposed services and ports
- Gather information on tech stack

### 2. Scanning & Enumeration
- Use automated scanners (Nmap, Nessus, OWASP ZAP)
- Enumerate users, endpoints, and resources
- Identify outdated dependencies

### 3. Exploitation
- Test for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- Attempt privilege escalation
- Test authentication and session management
- Check for data leakage and insecure storage

### 4. Post-Exploitation
- Attempt lateral movement
- Test persistence mechanisms
- Simulate data exfiltration

### 5. Reporting
- Document findings and severity
- Recommend remediation steps
- Retest after fixes

## Tools & Resources
- Nmap, Nessus, Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP
- Custom scripts for API fuzzing
- Social engineering (with approval)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All critical and high vulnerabilities remediated
- [ ] Pen test report delivered to stakeholders
- [ ] Retest confirms fixes
