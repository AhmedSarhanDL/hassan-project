# Cost Monitoring

This document describes the cost monitoring and optimization strategy for the Egypt Edututor platform.

## Overview

Cost monitoring ensures:
- Real-time tracking of cloud and LLM usage costs
- Alerts for budget overruns
- Cost allocation by service, user, and environment
- Recommendations for cost optimization

## Cost Tracking

### Cloud Infrastructure
- Use AWS Cost Explorer for daily cost breakdown
- Tag resources by environment, service, and owner
- Set up cost allocation reports
- Enable billing alerts via AWS Budgets

### LLM and API Usage
- Track LLM API usage (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
- Store usage logs in PostgreSQL
- Calculate cost per user/session
- Alert on abnormal usage spikes

## Dashboards
- Grafana dashboards for real-time cost visualization
- SRE dashboard for monthly/weekly cost trends
- Per-service and per-user breakdowns

## Optimization Strategies
- Rightsize EC2, RDS, and EKS clusters
- Use spot instances for batch jobs
- Auto-scale based on usage
- Review LLM model selection for cost/performance
- Archive old data to reduce storage costs

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Cost dashboards show real-time and historical data
- [ ] Alerts trigger on budget overruns
- [ ] Cost optimization recommendations are reviewed monthly
