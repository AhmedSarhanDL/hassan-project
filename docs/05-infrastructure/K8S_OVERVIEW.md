# Kubernetes Overview

This document provides an overview of the Kubernetes (K8s) infrastructure for the Egypt Edututor platform.

## Overview

Kubernetes is used for:
- Orchestrating backend and frontend services
- Autoscaling and self-healing deployments
- Secure service-to-service communication
- Rolling updates and canary deployments
- Resource monitoring and cost optimization

## Cluster Architecture
- Managed EKS cluster (AWS)
- Separate namespaces for staging, production
- Ingress via AWS ALB or NGINX
- Secrets managed via AWS Secrets Manager
- Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana

## Deployment Workflow
1. Build Docker images for backend/frontend
2. Push images to container registry
3. Deploy to EKS via ArgoCD or GitHub Actions
4. Run database migrations
5. Monitor health and scale as needed

## Security Practices
- RBAC for service accounts
- Network policies for pod isolation
- Secrets encrypted at rest
- Audit logging enabled

## Monitoring & Logging
- Prometheus for metrics
- Grafana for dashboards
- Loki for log aggregation
- Sentry for error tracking

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Cluster is deployed and operational
- [ ] Services are autoscaled based on load
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting are enabled
- [ ] Secrets are managed securely
