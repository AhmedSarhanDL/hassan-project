# Egypt Edututor Development Plan

This directory contains the comprehensive development plan for the Egypt Edututor platform, organized into **Proof of Concept (POC)** and **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** phases.

## Overview

The Egypt Edututor platform is an AI-powered tutoring system designed specifically for Egyptian K-12 students, focusing initially on Grade 9 mathematics. The platform leverages GraphRAG (Knowledge Graph + Vector Search), Arabic NLP, and adaptive learning algorithms to provide personalized educational experiences.

## Phase Structure

### POC Phase (5 Stories - 29 days)
The POC phase validates core concepts and demonstrates technical feasibility.

### MVP Phase (4 Stories - 80 days) 
The MVP phase builds a production-ready platform with advanced features and scalable infrastructure.
